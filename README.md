# Verilog-for-Dummies

## Preparing

1.  Choose / Check the computer you would like to use for this workshop:
   *  best Tool support you'll get with Ubuntu 16.04 or hence Mint 18
   *  much RAM (not smaller than 2 GB)

2.  Clone this github.com Repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/chipforge/Verilog-for-Dummies.git
```

3.  Please go to the _Scripts/bash_ directory, and then first read and later run the `install.sh` script:
```
more Scripts/bash/install.sh; sudo bash Scripts/bash/install.sh
```

4.  Do you already have installed a text editor? Really? I mean _vim_ or _emacs_. We do not talk about _notepad++_, _nedit_ or something for web hipsters with mouse support only.
   *  BTW, in the _Scripts/vim_ directory, you might find a minimalistic and useful vim configuration; move _vimrc_ to _~/.vimrc_ before usage.
